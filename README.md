# The Visualization toolbox of Text Mining

### Temporary, language used 繁體中文(zhtw) as subject.
### The very first version: 
- with Word Cloud, and segmenting to words [wordcloud_jieba.ipynb](./wordcloud_jieba.ipynb)<br>
![wordcloud](./assets/wordcloud.png)<br>
- to use a precise segmenting module [ckip_tagger.ipynb](./ckip_tagger.ipynb)
- a comparison method to show differences of TF-IDF scores, short article or sentences fit it [radar_plotting.ipynb](./radar_plotting.ipynb)<br>
![radarplot](./assets/radar_plot.png)<br>

### LDA-visualization
- A corpus level, huge volume of texts, to show pososible topic inside corpus [LDA_visualization.ipynb](./LDA_visualization.ipynb)<br> 
![ldavis](./assets/LDA_Vis_modules.png)<br>

### Word2Vec, and the others techniques
- A basical and small corpus downloaded from wikipedia, and utilizing with that to produce a tSNE plotting, showing the trained vector for each words, [word2vec_vis.ipynb](./word2vec_vis.ipynb).<br>
![word2vec](./assets/word2vec.png)<br>
- Now, some essay already proven that the 2 techniques, LDA and Word2Vec, could be combined to used.<br>
